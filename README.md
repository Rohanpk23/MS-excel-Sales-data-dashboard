I would really love if you can suggest some improvements as a pull request. 

This project is based on making a dashboard using a sales data from a  website. 
The sales data table consists of the product sales data. These are the following columns: 						
1. Distributor id						
2. Distributor name						
3. Country						
4. Product code						
5. Product (Categorical variable)						
6. Sales channel (Categorical variable)						
7. Date sold						
8. Day						
9. Quantity						
10. Unit Price						
11. Revenue						

KPI considered in the dashboard: 
1. Sales revenue
2. Units sold 
3. Distributors' count													
These are the questions that have been answered by the sales report:													
1. KPIs specific to products : Filters used in any combination; Sales channel adopted, Day, month 													
2. KPIs specific to Sales channels: Filters used in any combination; Country (TBD), Distributor(TBD), Day, Month													
3. Daily revenue and units sold for each month. 													
3. For distributors working in different countries, the KPIs (revenue and units sold) following filters can be applied in any combination:													
     a. Country													
     b. Sales Channel													
     c. Product													
     d. Day													
     e. Month	
     
 The TBD features are yet to be applied as improvements to the first version
